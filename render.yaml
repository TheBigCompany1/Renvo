  # ==================================
  # == PRODUCTION NODE.JS SERVICE ==

  - name: renvo-node-final
    type: web
    runtime: docker
    repo: https://github.com/TheBigCompany1/Renvo
    branch: main
    autoDeploy: true
    healthCheckPath: /api/ping
    # THE FIX: This line tells Render to create previews for this service
    # and which environment group to use for those previews.
    previewEnvVarGroup: renvo-staging
    # Note: Production envVars (like PYTHON_API_URL) are managed in the Render Dashboard.

  # ==================================
  # == PRODUCTION PYTHON SERVICE ==
  # ==================================
  - name: renvo-python
    type: web
    runtime: python

    # THE FIX: This line does the same for the Python service, linking
    # it to the same preview environment as the Node.js service.
    previewEnvVarGroup: renvo-staging
    # Note: Production envVars (API keys, REDIS_URL) are managed in the Render Dashboard.
