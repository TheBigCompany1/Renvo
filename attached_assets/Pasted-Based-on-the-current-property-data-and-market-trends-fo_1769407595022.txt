Based on the current property data and market trends for 4244 Mildred Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90066, here is a summary and assessment of its potential as a renovation and resale project.

1. Property Information Summary
Current Status: Off-market (Last sold in January 2024 for $1,550,000).

Specifications: 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, approximately 1,200 sq. ft.

Lot Size: 5,600 sq. ft. (Large for the area, typical dimensions 40’ x 140’).

Condition: The home was recently remodeled as a "Stunning Spanish Bungalow" prior to its 2024 sale. It features a modern chef’s kitchen, hardwood floors, a luxury primary suite, and a detached garage that could be converted into an ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit).

Location: Mar Vista (specifically the Culver West pocket). It is highly walkable and located near the beach, Abbot Kinney, and major shopping hubs.

2. Renovation & Resale Assessment
If you were to buy this property today at its current estimated market value (roughly $1.7M–$1.75M), your strategy would depend on the type of renovation:

A. Cosmetic Flip (Small Renovation)
Verdict: Poor Investment.

Reasoning: Because the house was already professionally remodeled in 2023/2024, there is very little "forced equity" to be gained through paint, flooring, or kitchen updates. You would likely be buying it at its peak value for a 2-bedroom home.

B. Massive Expansion / Development (The "Mar Vista Special")
Verdict: Strong Potential for Experienced Builders.

Reasoning: The real value in this specific block of Mildred Ave is the lot size. Several neighbors have expanded or rebuilt original 1,200 sq. ft. bungalows into 3,000+ sq. ft. modern luxury homes.

Nearby Comp: 4252 Mildred Ave (same block) is 3,213 sq. ft. and sold for $3,500,000.

Nearby Comp: 4224 Mildred Ave is 3,246 sq. ft. and is estimated at $3.2M+.

3. Profit Potential Analysis
To make a profit, you would likely need to follow the "Add-and-Build" model:

Acquisition Cost: ~$1,730,000 (Current Est. Value)

Construction Costs: Building in LA for high-end finishes currently averages $450–$600 per sq. ft.

Adding 1,800 sq. ft. (to reach a 3,000 sq. ft. total) = ~$900,000.

Hard/Soft Costs (Permits, architectural fees, holding costs) = ~$150,000.

Total All-In Investment: ~$2,780,000

Target Sale Price (ARV): $3,300,000 – $3,500,000

Potential Gross Profit: $520,000 – $720,000

Important Considerations:

Closing & Sales Costs: Real estate commissions (5%) and closing costs on a $3.4M sale will eat roughly $200,000 of that profit.

Timeline: Permitting in Los Angeles can take 6–12 months, and construction another 12 months. Your profit would be tied up for 2 years.

ADU Potential: Converting the detached garage into an ADU would add immediate rental income or resale value but costs roughly $150k–$250k in LA.

Final Verdict
Would I buy it to renovate?

If you are a first-time flipper: No. This property is too "nice" already. You want a "fixer" or a "teardown" which usually sells for $1.1M–$1.3M in this area. Buying a turnkey home at $1.7M to renovate it is overpaying for the entry point.

If you are a developer: Yes, if the price is right. If you can get it for closer to $1.6M, the deep lot (140 feet) provides enough space for a massive luxury expansion plus an ADU, which is the gold standard for profit in Mar Vista.

Can you make a profit? Yes, but only by increasing the square footage. You cannot flip this house in its current 1,200 sq. ft. footprint and expect to beat the high carrying costs and market appreciation.
